# Glassmorphism-login-form-UI
🔐 Login Form 

This project is a Login Form UI created using HTML and CSS.
It provides a clean and modern user interface for user authentication. The form includes fields for username and password, along with Remember Me and Forgot Password options.

The design uses CSS styling, a background image with gradient overlay, and a glassmorphism effect to enhance visual appeal. Font Awesome icons are added inside input fields to improve usability, while Google Fonts are used for better typography.

Overall, this project demonstrates how basic web technologies can be used to build a responsive, user-friendly, and professional login interface without using JavaScript.
